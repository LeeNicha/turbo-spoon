# Text Editors
## Basic Options
Many excellent text editors exist and good basic starting places are:

Operating System | Text Editor
---------------- | -----------
MacOS | [TextWranger](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/)
Ubuntu/Linux | gedit [built-in]
Windows |[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)

But I am a fan of Atom (see the [Atom website](https://atom.io)) made by the GitHub folks (if you're reading this you probably know a little about GitHub already). This is cross-platform, very easy to adjust to your preferences and a pleasure to use. There is a little bit of a learning curve to start with, but if you remember the main shortcut (Cmd-, on a mac) then you can always access the setting pane. Below is how I "pimp my Atom" (not formal advice).

## Atom Settings
### Settings
The principle setting I change is to ensure that "Show Invisibles" is selected in the "Editor" section of Settings. This helps a lot with tracking indents, etc.

### Multitasking trick I had figured out earlier
Files open tentatively by default. You can double-tap them (in the pane or on their tabs) so that they open permanently (and are not replaced by other files you open).

### Packages I have installed
You can install packages via the "Install" link in Settings. These are ones I have installed:

Package | Purpose
------- | -------
ask-stack | find answers in Stack Overflow
atom-beautify | will sort out indenting for you with a single click
color-picker | choose colours from a pallet
data-atom | run \*SQL commands
emmet | lots of code completion (incl. bracket closing)
expose | Cmd-Shift-E to get an expos√© style window picker
highlight-selected | as it says on the tin
language-r | language support for R
minimap | miniature version of script on right (helps you navigate)
minimap-cursorline | indicator of location in minimap
minimap-highlight-selected | extends function to minimap
minimap-pigments | extends function to minimap
open-recent | gives "Open Recent" option in File menu
pigments | loads of colour tools, incl. highlighting and tracking of colours in project
tablr | really cool way to display CSVs - still gives toggle to raw display

### Somewhat less used packages
These packages are good, but not always in use on my system:
* file-icons - gives file icons, but I inactivate this when using seti-ui (which comes with decent set; see below)
* language-arduino - you need an Arduino and a project!
* language-julia - Julia is cool, but you may not have it!
* git-time-machine - I haven't tried this yet.

### Themes
Appearance is everything. Atom allows control of UI (user interface) and syntax display. My currently installed **and activated** (see Themes section in Settings) UI theme is:
* seti-ui (brings icons with it as noted above)

And for my syntax theme:
* monokai-seti

A nice alternative set outside the defaults is:
* nord-atom-ui
* nord-atom-syntax
* *and activate "file-icons" from packages...*

### Protecting your sleep
Choosing themes is obviously an aesthetic matter, but when working late a dark screen is restful and healthful. On the latter, and if you wish to generally reduce your melantopic lux check out [f.lux software](https://justgetflux.com). The latest MacOS update gives yellow screen options (in SysPref, but default off), but f.lux seems more carefully designed to address the specific wavelengths of concern.
